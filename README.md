# True-Fiber-T626Pro-V1.0.0.5-Firmware

Analyzing this firmware out of a GPON device from Thailand.

## Building Firmware

This repository includes tools to rebuild the firmware from the extracted `squashfs-root-2` directory with automatic bad block handling for NAND flash.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build the firmware
./build-firmware.sh

# Test the build
./test-build.sh
```

The build script creates `T626Pro-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin` (~19MB) with:
- Squashfs filesystem (XZ compressed)
- Block alignment for NAND flash (128KB blocks)
- JFFS2 EOF markers for automatic bad block skipping

For detailed build instructions and technical information, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Device Access

You can try this Superadmin password but I believe it is different on every device. At least the two devices I had, both had different superadmin passwords. To get yours you need to Get a UART connection on the device using TX, RX, and Ground, power up the device and listen at baud rate 115200, once its finish log into the console using the console user and password below. Then read the contents of your ctromfile by cd /tmp and cat ctromfile.cfg | grep -i superadmin. The contents of the ctromfile.cfg also contains the information you need to clone your device to something like an XPON stick.
```xml
<FtpEntry Active="No" ftp_username="admin" ftp_passwd="skyworth" ftp_port="21" />
<ConsoleEntry Active="Yes" console_username="admin" console_passwd="$!%^kyw0rth" />
<TR64Entry/>
<Entry0 Active="Yes" username="superadmin" web_passwd="72af*9F-_-Ck!c@" display_mask="FF FF FF FF FF BF FF FF FF" pwd_control="1" Logged="0" LoginIp="192.168.1.36" Logoff="1" />
<TelnetEntry Active="No" telnet_username="admin" telnet_passwd="$O(Li0_o)$!%^" telnet_port="22666" />
<FtpEntry Active="No" ftp_username="admin" ftp_passwd="skyworth" ftp_port="21" />
```
to permenatly set telnet so you no longer have to use a UART connection:
```
tcapi set Account_TelnetEntry Active Yes
tcapi set Account_TelnetEntry telnet_passwd <your password>
tcapi set Account_TelnetEntry telnet_port 23
tcapi commit Account_TelnetEntry
```
Disabling TR069 by setting CWMP_Entry Active to No doesn't work as there is a read only script to restart it if its down. So just set the acsUrl to something bogus like http://example.com
```
tcapi set cwmp_Entry acsUrl http://example.com
tcapi commit cwmp_Entry
```
Or if you want to confuse 3BB and possible start a local ISP engineering war send the TR069 requests their way: 
```
tcapi set cwmp_Entry acsUrl http://acshuawei.3bb.co.th:9090/tr069
tcapi set cwmp_Entry acsUserName cpe                             
tcapi set cwmp_Entry acsUserPassword cpe
tcapi commit cwmp_Entry
```
